FDBwordsets
====

A collection of word and nonword sets culled from the literature on
naming and lexical decision. See help for each data set for details.

Compiled under supervision of Dave Braze. Devon Eddy did yoeman's
labor keying in data.

"Source" files for the wordsets, in the form of MS excel spreadsheet
per wordset, can be found in the inst/extdata subdirectory of this
package. A double entry method was used for entering data into these
files. Data is keyed into sheet1 and into sheet1 of each
file. Formulae in sheet3 compare entries in the first two sheets and
flag differences.

A script for converting the xlsx source files to rdata files can be
found in the inst/scripts subdirectory.

Key to phono alphabet is in the file "phonHarm1998-key.txt" located in
the inst/extdata subdirectory of this package.
