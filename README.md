FDBwordsets
====

A collection of word and nonword sets culled from the literature on
naming and lexical decision. See help for each data set for details.

Compiled under supervision of Dave Braze. Devon Eddy did yoeman's
labor in keying data.

Not yet ready for prime time.

+ Phono alphabet needs to be documented within the package.
+ transcription errors are present. See, for example, phono reps in
  g1979a1 for nonwords "cath", "coth", "cobe", "cose".
