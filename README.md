FDBwordsets
====

A collection of word and nonword sets culled from the literature on
naming and lexical decision. See help for each data set for details.

Compiled under supervision of Dave Braze. Devon Eddy did yoeman's
labor keying in data.

Key to phono alphabet is in the file "phonHarm1998-key.txt" located in
the inst/extdata directory of this package.

Maybe not yet ready for prime time.
+ transcription errors are present. See, for example, phono reps in
  g1979a1 for nonwords "cath", "coth", "cobe", "cose".
