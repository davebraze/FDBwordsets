FDBwordsets
====

A collection of word and nonword sets culled from the literature on
naming and lexical decision. See help for each data set for details.

Compiled under supervision of Dave Braze. Devon Eddy did yoeman's
labor keying in data.

"Source" files for the wordsets, in the form of MS excel spreadsheet
per wordset, can be found in the inst/extdata subdirectory of this
package.

A script for converting the xlsx source files to rdata files can be
found in the inst/scripts subdirectory.

Key to phono alphabet is in the file "phonHarm1998-key.txt" located in
the inst/extdata subdirectory of this package.

Maybe not yet ready for prime time.
+ transcription errors are present. See, for example, phono reps in
  g1979a1 for nonwords "cath", "coth", "cobe", "cose".
